Animation
=========

--- animation intro
2 types of animation
- game animation
-- you have a lot of control
-- you will have to come up with those controls
- transitions
-- less control
-- less work on your side as well

animation nutshell
- render something
- change it 60 times per second

24 fps like old tvs often looks jaggeddy on modern monitors

2 approaches to building animations
game loops
- more control

transitions
- easier to implement

--- Using game loop for rich animations
React is really fast
So we do 60 diff frames 

Game loop
- infinite loop where each iteration renders the next frame of your animation
- comes from video game industry
-- each frame as its own static representation of the game state
- take every object in the game and render it
-- then throw it away
-- make small adjustments and render again

React can figure out a diff btw hierarchical representations of your scene and rerender the appropriate objects
- Render a DOM from state
- Change some values in the state
- Trigger re-render


Game loop animation with a bouncy ball
--------------------------------------

--- bouncy ball animation
- d3.timer is better than setInterval

gravity is an acceleration pointing down
- it impacts the speed of the ball and not its position directly
1 render the ball
2 use an effect to start a timer with d3.timer
- like setInterval but better
3 ensure you clean up with timer.stop()
4 move the ball on each timer iteration (also known as a tick)
5 adjust the ball's speed to simulate gravity

solution
y and vy is part of [ball, setBall]

useEffect
function gameLoop 
setBall(ball => {
  let { y, vy } = ball;
  // bounce
  if (y > max_h) vy = -vy;
  return {
    y: y + vy,
    vy: vy + 0.1
  }
})
t = d3.timer(gameLoop)
return () => t.stop()
-- stops the timer when the component unmounts

g transform
circle

physics
- invert velocity when ground is reached
- add velocity to position
- add gravity to velocity



Use transitions for simple animation
------------------------------------

--- d3 animations with transitions
- you define start and stop and d3 does the rest
- give dom to d3 to do animations once it is done it gives it back to React

game loops are great for fine grained control
transition shines
- when all you need is a little flourish on user action


Build a swipe transition
------------------------
goal
build a component that handles transition internally and behaves like other React components externally

--- swipe video

save incoming prop into a state
- this triggers a render
- using state to render component
-- future prop changes won't render the component
-- this let's us run transitions

x prop changes
- useEffect runs and starts d3 transition
- blackbox rendering approach
-- d3 selects DOM node and takes over

d3 transition handles 
- animation
- manipulates DOM directly
- takes care of timing
- takes care of easing function

when transition ends, we update React state so React knows what's up
component re-renders again

--- solution
you can chain transitions
- it will happen sequentially and not in parallel
el.transition()
.duration(..)
.ease(d3....)
.transition()


Powerful animation with transitions and game loops combined
------------------------------------------------------------

donut to bar
1 A <Donut> component renders a bunch of <Arc>s
2 Each <Arc> takes care of its complex shape
...


--- Understanding custom tweens
- interpolator
-- calculates how to transition from point a to point b
-- has a param t
if you want to go from 10 to 20
inter(0.0) // 10
inter(0.5) // 15
inter(1.0) // 20

interpolator
- for numbers it is a function that parameterizes changes to a single argument
let i = d3.interpolateNumber(10, 20);
i(0.0) // 10
i(0.2) // 12
i(0.5) // 15
i(1.0) // 20

d3 can interpolate everything from numbers, to colors, and even objects or strings
- it does so by finding interpolatable parts of your argument and manipulating them linearly depending on the t parameter

sometimes you need custom interpolators - tweens
- i.e. animate an arc shape
-- path definition arg is a complex string

d3 lets us define custom transitions called tweens
- to smoothly animate a piechart we can build an arcTween
-- cuz piecharts are made of arcs
